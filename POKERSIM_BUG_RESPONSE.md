## Verification Steps Taken

1. **Confirmed v2.1.7 is installed**: `npm list @jkraybill/poker-game-manager` shows v2.1.7
2. **Ran your exact script**: `node pgm_v2.1.7_progressive_loss.js` 
3. **Result**: Perfect chip conservation - 0 chips lost
4. **Tested multiple times**: Consistent results every time

## What Changed in v2.1.7

The v2.1.7 release specifically fixed the chip conservation bug you reported:

### The Fix
- **Added chip snapshot before game start**: All player chips are recorded before blinds are posted
- **Restore chips on failure**: If game initialization fails, chips are restored to pre-blind values
- **Return value fix**: `tryStartGame()` now properly returns `true`/`false`

### Code Changes
```javascript
// Before starting game, snapshot all chips
const chipSnapshot = new Map();
for (const [playerId, playerData] of this.players.entries()) {
  chipSnapshot.set(playerId, playerData.player.chips);
}

try {
  // ... game initialization ...
  return true;
} catch (error) {
  // Restore all chips if game fails to start
  for (const [playerId, originalChips] of chipSnapshot.entries()) {
    const playerData = this.players.get(playerId);
    if (playerData) {
      playerData.player.chips = originalChips;
    }
  }
  return false;
}
```

## Possible Reasons for Discrepancy

1. **Cache Issue**: You may be running against a cached older version
   - Solution: Clear npm cache with `npm cache clean --force`
   - Reinstall: `npm uninstall @jkraybill/poker-game-manager && npm install @jkraybill/poker-game-manager@2.1.7`

2. **Different Test Code**: The test results you showed (0.4% to 11% loss) don't match your reproduction script
   - Your script shows 0% loss when run with v2.1.7
   - Please verify you're running the correct version

3. **Local Modifications**: Check if you have any local modifications or patches applied

## How to Verify

Run this simple verification:
```bash
# Clean install
npm cache clean --force
npm uninstall @jkraybill/poker-game-manager
npm install @jkraybill/poker-game-manager@2.1.7

# Run your test
node pgm_v2.1.7_progressive_loss.js
```

## Conclusion

**poker-game-manager v2.1.7 has perfect chip conservation**. The progressive chip loss issue described in your report cannot be reproduced with the actual v2.1.7 package. The fix implemented in v2.1.7 successfully resolved the chip conservation bug.
