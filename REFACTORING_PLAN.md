## 🚀 The Path to Poker Excellence (What's Next)

### 🔥 Priority 1: Critical Fixes (This Week)
1. **Issue #11 - Pot Distribution Bug** (90% complete)
   - Winners sometimes receive 0 chips despite winning
   - Critical for player trust and accuracy
   - Impacts complex side pot scenarios

2. **6-8 Player Scenarios** (Issue #5)
   - Complete the full spectrum of table sizes
   - Essential for tournament play simulation
   - Tests for complex multi-way dynamics

### 🎯 Priority 2: Championship Features (Next Month)

#### 📊 Analytics & Learning Engine
```javascript
// Track every decision for analysis
table.on('decision:made', (decision) => {
  const analysis = table.analyzeDecision(decision);
  // Returns: { ev: number, optimal: Action, leak: string }
});

// Post-session analysis
const session = table.getSession();
const report = analyzer.generateReport(session);
// Returns comprehensive stats: VPIP, PFR, 3-bet%, WTSD, etc.
```

#### 🎮 Training Mode
```javascript
// Practice specific scenarios
const trainer = new ScenarioTrainer();
trainer.loadScenario('bubble-play-10bb');
trainer.loadScenario('heads-up-deepstack');
trainer.loadScenario('multiway-pot-position');

// Get real-time coaching
trainer.on('decision:required', (state) => {
  const advice = trainer.getAdvice(state);
  // Returns: { recommended: Action, reasoning: string, ev: number }
});
```

#### 🤖 Advanced AI Opponents
```javascript
// Create opponents with distinct personalities
const opponents = [
  new AIPlayer({ style: 'TAG', level: 'expert' }),      // Tight-aggressive
  new AIPlayer({ style: 'LAG', level: 'advanced' }),    // Loose-aggressive
  new AIPlayer({ style: 'calling-station' }),           // Passive fish
  new AIPlayer({ style: 'maniac', tilt: true }),       // Tilted aggressor
  new AIPlayer({ style: 'GTO', deviation: 0.1 })       // Near-optimal with slight exploits
];

// AI with exploitable patterns
const fish = new AIPlayer({ 
  weaknesses: ['overvalues-pairs', 'chases-draws', 'folds-to-3bet-too-much']
});
```

### 🏆 Priority 3: Tournament Excellence (Next Quarter)

#### 🎪 Full Tournament Support
```javascript
const tournament = new Tournament({
  type: 'MTT',
  buyIn: 10000,
  startingStack: 30000,
  blindStructure: WSOP_MAIN_EVENT,
  payouts: TOP_15_PERCENT
});

// ICM-aware decisions
tournament.on('decision:required', (state) => {
  const icmPressure = tournament.calculateICM(state);
  // Adjusts strategy based on payout implications
});

// Satellite mode
const satellite = new Tournament({
  type: 'satellite',
  seats: 10,
  strategy: 'survival' // Changes optimal play significantly
});
```

#### 📹 Streaming & Replay Integration
```javascript
// Record for later analysis
const recorder = new HandRecorder(table);
const handHistory = recorder.exportToPokerStars();
const video = recorder.exportToVideo({ showHoleCards: true });

// Live streaming support
const stream = new LiveStream(table);
stream.setDelay(30); // seconds
stream.hideHoleCards(['player1', 'player2']); // Until showdown
```

### 🌟 Priority 4: Ecosystem & Community (Next 6 Months)

#### 🔌 Plugin Architecture
```javascript
// Create custom features
class CustomAnalyzer extends Plugin {
  onDecision(state, decision) {
    // Custom analysis logic
  }
}

table.use(new CustomAnalyzer());
table.use(new RangeVisualizer());
table.use(new EquityCalculator());
```

#### 📚 Learning Resources
- Interactive tutorials for each poker concept
- Video analysis of famous WSOP hands
- Strategy guides from basic to advanced
- Community-contributed scenarios

## 🎲 API Examples That Inspire

### Creating Your Path to Excellence
```javascript
import { PokerGameManager, TrainingMode, Analytics } from '@poker-manager/core';

// Start your journey
const manager = new PokerGameManager();
const analytics = new Analytics();

// Create a training table
const table = manager.createTable({
  mode: TrainingMode.POSITION_PLAY,
  opponents: 'adaptive', // AI adjusts to exploit your weaknesses
  stakes: { small: 1, big: 2 },
  startingStack: 100 // 100bb deep
});

// Track your improvement
table.use(analytics);

// Get real-time feedback
table.on('decision:made', ({ decision, optimal, ev }) => {
  if (decision !== optimal) {
    console.log(`Better play: ${optimal.action} (EV: ${ev.difference}bb)`);
  }
});

// Review your session
table.on('session:ended', () => {
  const report = analytics.generateReport();
  console.log('Leaks detected:', report.leaks);
  console.log('Improvement areas:', report.recommendations);
  console.log('Progress:', report.comparedToLastSession);
});
```

### Preparing for the Big Stage
```javascript
// Simulate WSOP Main Event conditions
const mainEvent = manager.createTournament({
  structure: WSOP_MAIN_EVENT_2024,
  field: 10000, // players
  startingStack: 60000,
  levels: [...OFFICIAL_BLIND_STRUCTURE]
});

// Practice specific day/situation
mainEvent.fastForwardTo({
  day: 3,
  averageStack: 400000,
  playersRemaining: 1000,
  yourStack: 250000 // Below average, need to make moves
});

// AI opponents based on real player types you'll face
mainEvent.populateWith([
  { count: 20, type: 'online-pro' },
  { count: 30, type: 'live-regular' },
  { count: 40, type: 'recreational' },
  { count: 10, type: 'sponsored-pro' }
