# Poker Game Manager 🃏

A high-performance, pure poker game management library for Node.js. Handles tournaments, tables, and games with a clean event-driven API that any player implementation can connect to.

## Current Status

- **Infrastructure**: ✅ Modern build tools configured (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest)
- **CI/CD**: ✅ GitHub Actions pipeline for Node.js 22 (all tests passing!)
- **Core API**: ✅ Foundation implemented (PokerGameManager, Table, Player, GameEngine)
- **Tests**: ✅ Comprehensive test suite (122 tests passing - all core components covered)
- **Hand Evaluation**: ✅ Integrated pokersolver library for robust hand evaluation
- **Active Work**: Ready for AI player implementations and tournament support
- **GitHub Issues**: [4 issues tracking progress](https://github.com/jkraybill/poker-game-manager/issues)

## Session Memory

### Latest Session (2025-07-19)
- ✅ Fixed GameEngine betting round logic bug (pre-flop bet reset issue)
- ✅ Fixed failing check action test in GameEngine
- ✅ Removed coverage requirements from CI (simplified pipeline)
- ✅ Enhanced Deck tests with 8 additional test cases:
  - Performance and reliability tests
  - Card immutability verification
  - Complex operation sequences
  - Statistical shuffle verification
  - Additional edge case handling
- ✅ Replaced custom HandEvaluator with pokersolver library:
  - Reduced code from 297 lines to 162 lines
  - Improved reliability with battle-tested library
  - Standardized card format to use pokersolver notation (T instead of 10)
- ✅ Written comprehensive tests for PotManager (32 tests):
  - Side pot calculations
  - Multi-way all-in scenarios
  - Pot distribution logic
- ✅ Written comprehensive tests for Table class (28 tests):
  - Player management and waiting lists
  - Game lifecycle management
  - Event forwarding
- ✅ All 122 tests passing (GameEngine, Deck, HandEvaluator, PotManager, Table)
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline fully green

### Previous Session
- ✅ Created comprehensive refactoring plan (REFACTORING_PLAN.md)
- ✅ Modernized package.json (Node 0.12.7 → 22+)
- ✅ Set up modern infrastructure (ESLint, Prettier, Vitest)
- ✅ Implemented core API foundation:
  - PokerGameManager for multi-table management
  - Table class with event-driven architecture
  - Player base class (simplified from adapter pattern)
  - GameEngine, Deck, HandEvaluator, PotManager
- ✅ Created GitHub issues for tracking (#1-#4)
- ✅ Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Removed all Slack dependencies - now a pure poker library
- ✅ Removed TypeScript configuration (pure JavaScript project)

### Key Decisions
- Created pure poker library (no platform dependencies)
- Simple player interface pattern (not adapter pattern)
- Target modern Node.js with ESM modules
- Implement multi-table support from ground up
- Focus on clean, event-driven API
- Pure JavaScript (no TypeScript)

## Architecture Vision

```javascript
// Clean, intuitive API
const manager = new PokerGameManager();
const table = manager.createTable({
  variant: 'texas-holdem',
  blinds: { small: 10, big: 20 }
});

// Add any player implementation
table.addPlayer(myPlayerImplementation);
table.addPlayer(aiPlayer);
table.addPlayer(remotePlayer);

// Event-driven architecture
table.on('game:ended', (result) => {
  console.log(`Winners: ${result.winners.join(', ')}`);
});

// Tournament support
const tournament = manager.createTournament({
  type: 'multi-table',
  buyIn: 1000,
  startingChips: 10000
});
```

## Original Slack Bot

This project started as a Slack bot for playing Texas Hold'em. The bot responds to `@poker deal` commands and manages games within Slack channels. See git history for original implementation.

## Performance Goals

- Sub-10ms action processing
- Support 1000+ concurrent tables
- Memory-efficient game state management
- Zero blocking operations in game loop

## MCP Integration

Using MCP tools for enhanced development:
- `sequential-thinking`: Architecture planning and decision tracking
- `github`: Version control and collaboration (when needed)
