    // but doesn't handle this specific edge case of multiple sequential all-ins.

    // - Main pot: 400 (100 from each), split among P1,P2,P3 who tie
    // - Side pot 1: 300 (100 from P2,P3,P4), split between P2,P3 
    // - Side pot 2: 200 (100 from P3,P4), won entirely by P3

    // 1. Track pot caps when players go all-in
    // 2. Automatically route subsequent bets to appropriate pots
    // 3. Handle creation of multiple side pots in sequence
