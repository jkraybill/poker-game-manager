  minPlayers: 4,    // Force specific player count
});

// 🧠 ADVANCED PLAYER WITH AI-READY API
class StrategicPlayer extends Player {
  getAction(gameState) {
    const myState = gameState.players[this.id];
    
    // 🎯 Advanced strategy using lastAction tracking
    if (myState.lastAction === Action.RAISE) {
      // React to own previous aggression
    }
    
    // 🎲 Squeeze play detection
    const raisers = Object.values(gameState.players)
      .filter(p => p.lastAction === Action.RAISE);
    const callers = Object.values(gameState.players)
      .filter(p => p.lastAction === Action.CALL);
      
    if (raisers.length === 1 && callers.length >= 1) {

## 🏆 TODAY'S ACHIEVEMENTS (2025-01-21 Session #2)

### 🎯 Test Suite Debugging Victory
- **🔍 ROOT CAUSE FOUND**: Event capture timing issues - `captureActions = false` set too early
- **✅ FIXED 5 TEST FILES**: Applied Promise-based event handling pattern
  - split-pot-simple.test.js ✅
  - split-pot-deterministic.test.js ✅
  - 4player-side-pots.test.js ✅
  - 5player-squeeze-play.test.js ✅
  - split-pot-scenarios.test.js (partial) ✅
- **⚡ MEMORY OPTIMIZATION**: Configured vitest with fork pool and limited concurrency
- **📋 CREATED ISSUE #16**: Comprehensive documentation of test failures and fixes

### 🛠️ Technical Solutions Applied
1. **Promise-based event handling**: Replaced unreliable `vi.waitFor` conditions
2. **Event capture fix**: Removed `captureActions = false` from hand:ended handlers
3. **Timing delays**: Added 100ms delay after events to ensure processing completes
4. **Memory config**: Limited test concurrency to prevent OOM errors

### 📚 Documentation Updates
- **CLAUDE.md**: Added Issue #16 as top priority with full details
- **README.md**: Updated to highlight test suite issues as critical priority
- **End-of-Session Checklist**: Added comprehensive guide for future Claudes

## 🔥 SESSION END NOTES (2025-01-21)

### Current Blockers
1. **Memory Issues**: Full test suite still runs out of memory despite optimizations
2. **Remaining Test Failures**: 
   - 3 more split-pot-scenarios tests need Promise-based fix
   - 6-8 player scenario tests failing
   - table-explicit-start tests hanging
3. **Custom Deck Test**: Still hanging after flop phase (from previous session)

### Key Discoveries Today
1. Event capture timing was the root cause of most test failures
2. Promise-based event handling is more reliable than vi.waitFor conditions
3. Tests pass individually but memory leaks prevent full suite execution
4. Vitest fork pool helps but isn't sufficient for large test runs

### Next Session Priorities
1. **Apply remaining fixes**: Complete Promise-based conversion for all failing tests
2. **Memory leak investigation**: Find root cause of memory issues
3. **Test suite refactor**: Consider breaking large test files into smaller ones
4. **Cleanup patterns**: Add proper afterEach cleanup to free memory
