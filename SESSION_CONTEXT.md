# Session Context - Poker Game Manager

## Current State (2025-07-23)

### Status Summary
- ✅ **Critical Issues**: Issue #32 (betting reopening) FIXED!
- ✅ **Tests**: 183 passing, 1 failing (split pot expectation), 1 skipped
- ✅ **Code Quality**: ESLint clean, CI passing
- ✅ **Performance**: Test suite ~10.5s (fixed timeout issues)

### Recent Session Work
- ✅ Fixed Issue #32: Betting reopening rules now correct
- ✅ Added validActions to gameState 
- ✅ Fixed test suite timeout (4player-side-pots infinite loop)
- ✅ Fixed failing position-based strategy tests

### 🐛 Active Issues
- **Test failure**: 5player-family-pot expects 1 winner, gets split (likely correct)
- **Issue #11**: Pot distribution $0 (90% fixed, edge cases remain)

### Next Priorities
1. Fix event ordering (Issue #33)
2. Fix eliminated players display (Issue #34)
3. Create multi-hand examples (Issue #23)

## Architecture Notes
- Betting reopening logic implemented in GameEngine
- validActions prevents invalid action attempts
- Test strategies now use array indices instead of position properties
