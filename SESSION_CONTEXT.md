# SESSION CONTEXT - Poker Game Manager

## Current Status (2025-07-31)
- **✅ ALL TESTS PASSING**: 231 tests passing, CI green
- **✅ ESLint compliant**: All code follows project style rules
- **✅ Test Utilities Migration COMPLETE**: Issue #9 finished - all integration tests migrated
- **✅ Dead button implementation**: Partial implementation complete, prevents BB double-posting

## Recent Changes (2025-07-31)
- **COMPLETED Issue #9: Test Utilities Migration**
  - Total of 10 integration test files migrated to use test utilities
  - All tests now use StrategicPlayer instead of extending Player class
  - Consistent use of createTestTable, setupEventCapture, and waitForHandEnd
  - Note: GameEngine.test.js was not migrated as it's a unit test with mocks
- **Fixed CI issues**:
  - Resolved ESLint errors in test files (formatting)
  - Fixed 7player-scenarios test for split pot remainder distribution
- **Issue #37 Dead Button**: 
  - Reviewed implementation - partial support exists
  - Architectural limitation prevents full implementation
  - Current code prevents players from posting BB twice (core requirement)
  - Full implementation requires v2.0 breaking changes

## Next Priorities
1. Issue #5 - Complete multi-player betting scenarios (4-8 players)
2. Issue #14 - Build complete tournament management system
3. Issue #13 - Implement training mode with scenario practice
4. Issue #12 - Add analytics & learning engine
5. Issue #37 - Full dead button implementation (requires v2.0)

Note: Issues #32, #33, #34 are already closed/completed
