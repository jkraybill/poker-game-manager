# 🚀 SESSION CONTEXT - ESLINT FULLY CLEAN!

## 🎉 CURRENT STATE

**Status**: 194 tests passing, 0 ESLint errors, fully clean codebase
**Latest**: V2 test migration complete + ESLint fully clean 

### Key Facts:
- Player class is single source of truth for state
- V2 test utilities used throughout
- No memory leaks or test isolation issues
- Pot distribution bug (Issue #11) still present but handled gracefully

## 🔥 Next Session Priorities

### 1. Fix Pot Distribution Bug
- **🐛 Issue #11**: With Player as single source of truth, this should be easier to fix
- Run comprehensive tests on pot distribution
- Verify no winners get 0 chips OR more than pot total

### 2. Complete 6-8 Player Scenarios
- **🎯 Issue #5**: Finish remaining betting scenarios
- Add more complex multi-way pots
- Test edge cases with new architecture

### 3. Build on Stable Foundation
- **🤖 AI Player Examples**: Create strategic player implementations
- **🏆 Tournament Mode**: Add multi-table tournament support
- **⚡ Performance Benchmarks**: Establish baseline metrics


## ⚡ POKER POWER COMMANDS
```bash
# 🎯 TESTING EXCELLENCE
npm test                    # All 186 tests passing!
npm test -- 4player-side-pots  # Specific poker scenario
npm test -- -t "family pot"  # Pinpoint test search

# 🛠️ DEVELOPMENT MASTERY
npm run lint && npm run format && npm test  # Pre-commit perfection
npm run build              # Production-ready build

# 🚀 GIT EXCELLENCE
git status && git diff     # Battle-tested workflow
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: poker mastery" && git push

# 🎲 JK'S POKER SHORTCUTS
go!   # UNLEASH THE POKER ENGINE!
go?   # Strategic questions then DOMINATE
??    # Tactical clarification
flush # Deploy poker excellence to production
```

## 🎯 KNOWN ISSUES
1. **🐛 Issue #11**: Pot distribution bug - should be easier to fix now
2. **📋 Issue #5**: 6-8 player scenarios incomplete
3. **🤖 Issue #4**: Need AI player examples
4. **🏆 Issue #3**: Tournament support not implemented

## 🛠️ TECHNICAL PATTERNS ESTABLISHED

### Race Condition Fix Pattern
```javascript
// In event handler
setTimeout(() => resolve(), 50);  // Allow state updates

// After awaiting events
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 200-600));  // CI needs time
```

### Memory Leak Prevention
```javascript
// Always clean timeouts
clearTimeout(timeoutId);

// Remove all listeners
this.gameEngine.removeAllListeners();

// Null references
this.gameEngine = null;
```

### Promise-Based Event Handling
```javascript
const handResult = new Promise((resolve) => {
  table.on('hand:ended', ({ winners }) => {
    if (!handEnded) {
      handEnded = true;
      resolve(winners || []);
    }
  });
});
```
