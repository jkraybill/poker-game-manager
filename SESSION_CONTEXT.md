# SESSION CONTEXT - Poker Game Manager

## Current Status (2025-07-31)
- **✅ ALL TESTS PASSING**: 231 tests passing, CI green
- **✅ ESLint compliant**: All code follows project style rules
- **✅ Test Utilities Migration COMPLETE**: Issue #9 finished - all integration tests migrated

## Recent Changes (2025-07-31)
- **COMPLETED Issue #9: Test Utilities Migration**
  - Total of 10 integration test files migrated to use test utilities
  - All tests now use StrategicPlayer instead of extending Player class
  - Consistent use of createTestTable, setupEventCapture, and waitForHandEnd
  - Note: GameEngine.test.js was not migrated as it's a unit test with mocks
- Migrated files today:
  - elimination-ordering.test.js
  - elimination-display-fixed.test.js
  - event-ordering-elimination.test.js
  - issue-11-minimal-repro.test.js
  - memory-leak-repro.test.js
  - standings-display.test.js
  - dealer-button-rotation.test.js
- Previous: betting-reopening-simple.test.js, eliminated-player-display.test.js
- All test migrations maintain 100% pass rate

## Next Priorities
1. Issue #32 - All-in betting reopening rules (CRITICAL for tournament integrity)
2. Issue #33 - Event ordering improvements (stability)
3. Issue #34 - Eliminated player display fix (quick UX win)
