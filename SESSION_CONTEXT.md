### **Migration Guide for v2.0.0**
```javascript
// OLD (v1.x) - Table automatically bought in players
const player = new Player({ name: 'Alice' });
table.addPlayer(player); // Player got minBuyIn chips automatically

// NEW (v2.x) - Must set chips before adding
const player = new Player({ name: 'Alice' });
player.buyIn(50000); // Tournament starting stack
table.addPlayer(player); // Player joins with their chips
```

### **Next Steps**
- **For Users**: Update to v2.0.0 and adjust player initialization code
- **For Development**: The Big 3 features remain in backlog:
  - Analytics Engine (Issue #12)
  - Training Mode (Issue #13)
  - Tournament System (Issue #14)

### **Key Commands**
```bash
npm test          # Run all 239 tests
npm run lint      # Code quality check  
npm run build     # Build for distribution
npm publish       # Publish to GitHub Packages
```

## 🏆 What We've Accomplished

**v2.0.0 represents a major step toward true tournament excellence.** 

By removing table-level buy-in restrictions, we've:
- **Enabled proper tournament support** - Tables accept any stack size
- **Separated concerns correctly** - Buy-in policies belong at tournament/room level
- **Maintained backward compatibility where possible** - Player.buyIn() still works
- **Improved flexibility** - Cash games and tournaments can now use the same table implementation

**The path to championship poker software continues!** 🎯
