- **Passing**: 185 (99.5%)
- **Skipped**: 1 (complex multi-way split - documented)
- **Architecture**: Clean, modular test structure

## Key Technical Achievements
- First-class Pot objects for proper encapsulation
- Comprehensive multi-player testing (2-8 players)
- Tournament scenarios (bubble play, short stacks)
- Event-driven architecture working flawlessly

## Immediate Priorities
1. **WARM**: Create example AI player implementations
2. **FUTURE**: Handle complex sequential all-in edge case (skipped test)
3. **FUTURE**: Build tournament management system (Issue #14)

## Next Session Tasks
1. Create AI player examples
2. Consider implementing sequential all-in handling for edge case
